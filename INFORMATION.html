	<p>Hello, my name is Liam J, you can call me Liam or JJ.</p>
	<p>I'm an animator, artist, game dev, coder (simple) and soon to be comic artist. I like to draw gore and mature related content, if you are sensitive i advice to look at something else.</p>
	<p>After all i'm just someone who wants to have fun in the end. I longed to publish my stories one day, and i hope we can all get connected, as people too.</p>
	<p>If you want to contact me, please check my <b>QNA</b> section first, thank you.</p>
